df = pd.read_csv

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with pd
head() - returns first five observations of the data set.
tail() - returns last five observations of the data set.
shape() - ret (observations,characteristics) i.e, (row,col)
          n-1 col = independent variables
info() - ret data types, non-Null values count (which gives null/missing values count).
describe() - ret summary of various statistics.
             count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and the quantiles of the data.
             min to max values shows the ascending order (min, 25%, 50%, 75%, max) of data col, 
             50% is median value.
             Observe difference of val between min and max range and if there any high diff and there
             is outliers in the dataset.
tarVar.value_counts() - score/count in descending order based on categories
                        *Target variable/Dependent variable is discrete and categorical in nature
df.corr() - 
df.target.value_counts() - returns the total count of each catogorical data
##pandas
groupby() - function is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria
crosstab
apply() - function is passed as arg, the functionn will be applied to pandas series/data
